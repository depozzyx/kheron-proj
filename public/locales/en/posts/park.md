There were no major military events on the territory of Kherson, apparently because the Germans did not have to take them out of here. But there is a monument to the soldiers of the Second World War, it stands in a park on the banks of the Dnieper.

Despite the fact that this park was built during the Soviet Union, in the 60s, despite the enormous internationalism, Ukrainian Cossack roots stick out in the Kherson region. And when the then regional party committee was given the task of building a monument to the soldiers, then, of course, they thought that it would be some kind of warrior with a sword or something like that.

But in the end you will see: a Ukrainian woman with a wreath and ribbons is standing, looking into the distance and, apparently, waiting for someone. She seems pretty cheerful. Closer, the monument seems even more grandiose and fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape. A beautiful view of the Dnieper and smooth ones opens from the platform nearby. The reeds from there were used to cover houses, build boats, fences, and they also became the main raw material for the Tsyurupinsky paper mill, which, unfortunately, is now closed. These smooth ones previously stretched to the Dnipropetrovsk region, until they built a hydroelectric power station and they were flooded by the largest reservoir - the Kakhovka Sea.
