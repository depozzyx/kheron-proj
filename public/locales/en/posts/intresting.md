** Kherson ** was founded by order of Empress Catherine II. Prince Grigory Potemkin built it as a southern outpost against enemies. Dreaming of giving the new city the metropolitan grandeur of “southern Petersburg”, Prince Tavrichesky conceived a temple in the classical style - St. Catherine's Cathedral. It was built in 1876 and is dedicated to the saint whose name the empress bore. She herself attended a divine service in the cathedral in 1877.

** St. Catherine's ** Cathedral was included in the ensemble of the Kherson fortress. A military necropolis was founded behind the fence of the cathedral - noble people and officers who died in the battles of the Russian-Turkish war were buried here.

After the death of her favorite, Empress Catherine II ordered to erect a ** monument to Potemkin ** in the center of Kherson. And the monument was erected in 1836. Later, Potemkinsky Boulevard was laid nearby. After the 1917 revolution, the monument was hidden under a tarpaulin from the public eye, it was called the "Kherson ghost". In 1944, when the fascist invaders were leaving Kherson, the monument disappeared along with them. It was restored in 2003 in Potemkin Square.

Potemkin's creation - ** Kherson Fortress ** - has partially survived to this day. At one time it was the most powerful fortification, inside which there was a square with the palace of Potemkin himself and the Catherine's Cathedral. The building of the fortress's arsenal, the powder magazine converted into a restaurant, as well as the identical Moscow and Ochakov gates have survived to this day. Interestingly, in our time, Scythian burials have been found on the territory of the Kherson fortress.

** Admiralty Arsenal ** - one of the oldest buildings in Kherson. It was built at the end of the 18th century, but was badly damaged by an earthquake and was rebuilt in 1812.

To the southeast of the Catherine Cathedral there is a memorial ** Park of Glory ** in memory of the heroes of the Second World War who liberated Kherson. A touching monument to the Grieving Mother has been erected, here is the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, memorial lists of the victims. This is a sacred place, but, nevertheless, one of the most beautiful in Kherson. The central alley of the park goes down to the river, and the view here is simply amazing.

_ ** The central highway ** _ of the city bears the name of the great naval commander, Admiral Fyodor ** Ushakov **. It is known that he arrived in Kherson as a captain of the second rank, was forced to fight the plague in the city and, in fact, saved him. From this in Kherson his career began and then the brilliant success of a naval officer.

A monument to Ushakov was erected near the main building of the Kherson State Maritime Academy. In addition, other buildings of marine educational institutions can be seen on the avenue.

There are many interesting old buildings and shopping centers along the avenue, and fountains will delight you on a summer day. It is interesting that not a single street crosses Ushakov Avenue - they all originate from it.
