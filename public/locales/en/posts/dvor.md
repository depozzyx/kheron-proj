The city soul and color live in courtyards and lanes, in entrances and lanes. Here you will hear gossip, legends, stories and true facts.

"Kherson Courtyards" is a thematic pedestrian walk that runs through the old center. We will visit quiet back streets, streets, courtyards and entrances. A charismatic guide will tell about the stories of those who lived here and who came to Kherson, explain the difference in the structure of estates, tell about mysterious symbols and signs. You will pass where few people walk. There are plenty of these places in the city, where the foot of an ordinary Kherson citizen has never gone before.

You can run down the same street to and from work every day, and you don't know its history, don't know "what's around that turn" or don't know that you can walk faster "right away" by reducing the whole block. Living for years in your hometown, but not really seeing and hearing it is not acceptable. Time to change.
